# Platform engineering for devs

Welcome to this workshop focusing on enhancing your dev experience by:
- Using a remote environment customized to your needs for a fast start on a project
- Creating temporary test environments to assess your changes while being compliant with your organization policies
- Using tools which can simplify the experience of managing environments on Azure and deploying your workload code
- Leveraging load testing as a means for early issue detection
- Debugging issues in a distributed workload

During this workshop you will have the instructions to complete each steps. It is recommended to search for the answers in provided resources and links before looking at the solutions placed under the 'ðŸ“š Toggle solution' panel.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> You will find the instructions and expected configurations for each Lab step in these yellow **TASK** boxes.
> Inputs and parameters to select will be defined, all the rest can remain as default as it has no impact on the scenario.
>
> Use the provided credentials to Log into the Azure subscription locally using Azure CLI and on the [Azure Portal][az-portal].
> Instructions and solutions will be provided for `azd`, `Azure CLI`, and the portal, but you can also opt for using the Azure Portal during the entire workshop if you prefer.

## Scenario

The goal of the workshop is to edit the code of a simple Order management API, deploy it to Azure, and detect potential issues using load tests and monitoring.

We will be using the following services:
- [Microsoft Dev Box (DevBox)][devbox]
- [Azure Deployment environment (ADE)][ade]
- [Azure Developer CLI (AZD)][azd]
- [Azure Load Testing][loadtesting]
- [Application Insights][appinsights]

TODO: add a diagram to illustrate the scenario and more details to the various services ?

# Lab 1 : Make changes to the project

## Setup your dev environment

TODO: add a brief description of Dev Box and its advantages

We will be using a Dev Box with a customized image intended for full stack development. The Dev Box includes [VS Code][vscode] with few extensions, nodejs, git, az cli, and azd.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Log into the Developer portal and connect to your Dev Box
> - Open VS Code

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Open the [Developer portal][devportal]
1. Sign in using the provided credentials.
1. Locate your Dev Box and click on the `Open in RDP client` button
1. Click on the `Connect` button
1. Wait until the Dec Box starts
1. Open VS Code
1. Check the installed extensions, you should be able to see Azure and Github extensions (among others)

</details>

## Clone the project

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Clone the project https://github.com/ikhemissi/platform-engineering-summit-2024

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

Use the integrated terminal to run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikhemissi/platform-engineering-summit-2024.git
```

</details>

## Update the code

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Update the `qna` endpoint in `service/api/src/api.js` by prefixing the return value with a prefix of your choice

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Open the file `service/api/src/api.js`
1. Locate the line `answer: '42',`
1. Replace '42' with 'PREFIX 42' where `PREFIX` is your initials
