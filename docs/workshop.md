# Lab 1 : Make changes to the project

## Setup your dev environment

Azure DevBox is a development environment provided by Microsoft Azure. It's essentially a cloud-based, pre-configured development environment that developers can use to write, run, and debug their code. Here are some of its advantages:

- **Pre-configured Environment**: Azure DevBox comes with a pre-configured development environment, which includes a variety of popular programming languages, development tools, and frameworks. This saves developers the time and effort of setting up their own environment.
- **Anywhere Access**: Since Azure DevBox is cloud-based, developers can access their development environment from anywhere, on any device. This makes it a great tool for remote teams and flexible working arrangements.
- **Scalability**: Azure DevBox can easily scale up or down based on the needs of the project. This means developers can choose the right amount of resources for their project, without having to worry about over or under-provisioning.
- **Integration with Azure Services**: Azure DevBox is fully integrated with other Azure services, making it easy to build, test, and deploy applications that use these services.
- **Security**: Azure DevBox is hosted on Azure, which means it benefits from Azure's security measures. This includes features like Azure Security Center, Azure Active Directory, and compliance offerings.
- **Collaboration**: Azure DevBox supports real-time collaboration between developers. This makes it easier for teams to work together on the same codebase, regardless of their physical location.

We will be using a Dev Box with a customized image intended for full stack development. The Dev Box includes [VS Code][vscode] with few extensions, nodejs, git, az cli, and azd.

# Lab 2 : Deploy your code to Azure

In this second lab we will focus on how to deploy our services to Azure.

To do this we need to:

- Provision resources on Azure like the compute service which will host our code, the database, and the monitoring service
- Package our code and deploy it to the provisioned resources

## Provision resources on Azure

Resource provisioning can be done [in many ways][resourcemanager]:

- (Recommended) Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like Bicep and Terraform
- Using the Azure CLI
- Using APIs and SDKs
- From the Azure Portal

Working with IaC can be a challenge in some contexts like defining who can do what:

- Who will be writing the IaC and guaranteeing it is compliant with company standards and best practices ?
- Who will be creating resources using IaC, and how ?

[Azure Deployment Environments][ade] solves this problems by providing a framework for authoring "environment definitions", provisioning them, assigning resources to projects, and handling permissions.
Environments can be created directly from the [Developer portal][devportal] or using a compatible tool like Azure Developer CLI (`azd`).

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Create a new environment using the `Function` definition

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Open the [Developer portal][devportal]
1. Sign in using the provided credentials if needed
1. Click on the `New` button on the top left and click on the `New environment` option. Copy the chosen name.
1. Choose a short name and select `Project-1``
1. Select the environment type `Dev` and the `Function` definition
1. Hit `Next`
1. Use the same environment name as in the previous step and leave the location as is.
1. Hit `Create` and wait for the environment to be created

</details>

## Deploy services

[`azd`][azd] simplifies the process of creating resources and deploying code by providing a simple abstraction on top of the various integrations (e.g. with compute and management services).

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Using [`azd`][azd], select the ADE environment which you have previously created
> - Deploy services to the selected environment

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Log into Azure using `azd`

```sh
azd auth login
```

2. List available environments

```sh
azd env list
```

3. Select the remote environment which was created via Dev portal

```sh
azd env select <ade-environment-name>
```

4. Deploy services to the selected environment using the configuration defined in `azure.yaml`

```sh
azd deploy
```

Follow the wizard and wait until the deployment finishes.
You should have access to the deployed service url (e.g. Function App) and the resource group which was used for the deployment.

</details>

## Test deployed services

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Test the newly deployed function and make sure the changes you made in the last step of Lab 1 are being taken into account in the response of the function.

</div>

<div class="tip" data-title="Tips">

> You can use the supplied `test.http` file to test the newly deployed function

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Open the `test.http`
1. Update the `@host` variable to point to your Function App
1. Use the `Send Request` button on top of line 3 to send a request
1. Make sure you see the change you made at the end of Lab 1 (e.g. adding a prefix to the response)

# Lab 3 : Load testing

## Create a load test

Using load testing can help identify potential issues (e.g. errors and latency) very early and reduce the impact of these issues on your users.

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows developers to simulate high volumes of user traffic to their applications. This service is designed to identify potential performance bottlenecks and ensure that applications can handle high loads, especially during peak times.

Benefits of Azure Load Testing:

- **Scalability**: Azure Load Testing can simulate thousands to millions of virtual users, allowing you to test your application under various load conditions.
- **Ease of Use**: With its intuitive interface and pre-configured test templates, Azure Load Testing makes it easy to set up and run load tests.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Azure Load Testing provides detailed reports and real-time analytics, helping you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
- **Cost-Effective**: With Azure Load Testing, you only pay for what you use. This makes it a cost-effective solution for load testing.

Integration with other services:

Azure Load Testing integrates seamlessly with other Azure services. For instance, it can be used in conjunction with Azure Monitor and Application Insights to provide detailed performance metrics and insights. It also integrates with Azure DevOps, allowing you to incorporate load testing into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Run the test

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Create a Load test for the Function endpoint
> - Limit the duration of the test to 3 minutes

</div>

<div class="tip" data-title="Tips">

> Use the direct integration of [Azure Load Testing with Azure Functions][functionloadtesting]

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Locate the Function App in the Azure Portal
1. Click on the `Load Testing (Preview)` blade
1. Click on the `Create test` button
1. Select the existing Azure Load Testing resource and provide a short name and description of the test
1. Click on `Add request`
1. Make sure the pre-populated request points to your Function endpoint and uses the right HTTP method (`POST`)
1. Select the body tab, set the `Data type` value to `JSON view`, and paste the request body used in the file `test.http`
1. Valide the request using the `Add` button
1. Select the tab `Load configuration` and set `Test duration (minutes)` to 3
1. Click on `Review + create` then on `Create`
1. The test will take few seconds to get created and then you should see a popup telling you that the test has started

</details>

As the test starts, you will see a `Load test results` dashboard with various metrics like the total number of requests, throughput, and error percentage.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Find out the average response time ?

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Locate the `Aggregation` filter in the `Client-side metrics` panel
1. Uncheck existing selection, select `Average`, then click on `Apply`
1. Locate the metric below the graph in `Response time (successful responses)`. That is the average response time.

</details>

# Lab 4 : Investigate errors

As you add new features to your application, few regressions may appear, hence the need for testing and monitoring to detect and fix these regressions.

To simulate making changes and deploying new releases, the provided Function App relies on the `RELEASE` environment variable to control its behaviour and introduce regressions like throwing errors and injecting latency.

## Simulate a new release

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Update the config of the Function Apps by setting the environment variable `RELEASE` to `2`. The function should start throwing errors for 10% of the requests.

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>

1. Open the resource group on Azure portal
1. Locate the Function App
1. Click on the `Environment variables` blade
1. Click on the `RELEASE` environment variable to edit it
1. Set the value to `2` and hit `Apply`
1. Hit `Apply` to validate all changes on environment variables
1. Select `Confirm`

The Function App will reload and then it will adapt its behavior to throw errors at a 10% rate

</details>

## Re-run load testing

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - Re-run the load test which you have created in the previous lab and observe if there are any changes compared to before

</div>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“š Toggle solution</summary>
